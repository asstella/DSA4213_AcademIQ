      "The text discusses the topic of the green agenda, which generally refers to a political movement that promotes environmental protection and sustainable development. However, the author suggests that many governments only pay lip service to the environmental movement in order to placate people and gain political capital, while not taking concrete actions to reduce their carbon emissions or address climate change. The author points out that many countries have signed international agreements on climate change, but are not meeting their targets. The text also notes that while some individuals and companies are making efforts to be more environmentally friendly, such as using reusable cutlery or producing metal straws, these actions often only extend to superficial materialistic aspects and do not truly consider the impact on the livelihood of future generations.\n",

      "The author uses Singapore as an example of a country that has made significant strides in implementing green initiatives, such as constructing the world's largest floating solar power plant and kickstarting a cooling project to make the city greener and more liveable. However, the text also notes that many other countries have brushed aside the green agenda in pursuit of their own goals. The author argues that every single person has a duty to care for the earth and that the true meaning behind the green agenda is collective good. The text concludes by stating that a firm and sincere commitment to protecting the earth is needed from every country, especially developed ones like America, and that individual consideration of the green agenda remains materialistic, superficial, and grossly inadequate. The author implores individuals to take concrete steps to protect the earth, beyond just physical items and profit motives.\n"
